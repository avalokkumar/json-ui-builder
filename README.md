### **Core Idea & Features**
- Accept JSON input from users. [Done]
- Render JSON data in different UI structures (e.g., table, tree, card, list). [TODO]
- Allow users to customize UI (layout, color schemes, font size).  [TODO]
- Provide a live preview of the selected UI.  [TODO]
- Allow exporting UI as HTML/CSS/JS for embedding elsewhere. [TODO]
